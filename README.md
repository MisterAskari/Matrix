In C++ programming language, we wrote a program that can make changes to matrices, for example, create a matrix or add an element to it, or perform mathematical operations with it,
such as adding and multiplying matrices. In addition, we sorted the matrices and wrote a function in addition to the previous ones to search in the matrices.
